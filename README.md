## tic-tac-toe

The game we all loved as kids, tic•tac•toe can be played on the command line. Originally written in Python from an article. I took that and converted it to Go.
In addition I changed a number of things from the original. All the spaces initially will display the initial index from 0-8 so as to reduce confusion.
Clone repo and then run `go run main.go` to enjoy a two player game of tic•tac•toe.
